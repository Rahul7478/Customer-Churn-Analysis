# Customer-Churn-Analysis
📊 Customer Churn Analysis – End-to-End Data Analytics Project
Customer churn is a silent revenue killer, and this project is designed to uncover the real reasons behind it 🔍. Using a real telecom customer dataset, I performed in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics, service usage, contracts, and payment behaviors. To go a step further, I applied Survival Analysis ⏳ to study customer lifetime and retention patterns over time using Kaplan–Meier curves and statistical tests. Finally, I built a Machine Learning Churn Prediction Model 🤖 using Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning to identify high-risk customers before they leave. This project combines analytics, statistics, and machine learning to deliver actionable insights 📈 that can help businesses reduce churn, improve retention strategies, and make data-driven decisions.
